# Rain Alert App

## Overview

This project is a weather alert application that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and the Twilio API to send WhatsApp alerts to users. The app checks for rain conditions in the next 12 hours and sends a notification accordingly. If rain is expected, a message is sent to remind the user to carry an umbrella, and if it's sunny, a message is sent to inform them of the pleasant weather.

## Key Features

- **Weather Forecasting**: Fetches 5-day weather data with 3-hour intervals using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Real-time Alerts**: Sends WhatsApp alerts via Twilio when rain is forecasted.
- **Environment Variables**: Utilizes environment variables to securely store sensitive information, such as API keys and Twilio credentials.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Twilio Python library (`twilio`)
- Requests library (`requests`)
- `python-dotenv` for environment variable management
- OpenWeatherMap API key
- Twilio account SID and Auth Token

## Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install requests twilio python-dotenv
   ```
````

2. **Set Up .env File**:
   Create a `.env` file in your project root and add the following lines:

   ```env
   OWM_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
   AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
   ```

   Replace `your_openweathermap_api_key` with your OpenWeatherMap API key and `your_twilio_auth_token` with your Twilio Auth Token.

3. **Twilio Setup**:
   - Sign up at [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) if you haven't already.
   - Get your Twilio Account SID and Auth Token from the [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console).
   - Set up a WhatsApp sandbox in Twilio and get the WhatsApp-enabled phone number.

## How It Works

1. The app uses **OpenWeatherMap API** to fetch the weather forecast for the next 12 hours.
2. It checks the weather condition codes in the response to determine if rain is expected.
3. If rain is expected, the app sends a **WhatsApp message** using the **Twilio API** to alert the user.
4. If it's sunny, a different message is sent to inform the user about the clear weather.

## Code Explanation

```python
import requests
from twilio.rest import Client
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

# Twilio account SID and Auth Token
account_sid = "your_twilio_account_sid"
auth_token = os.getenv("AUTH_TOKEN")

# OpenWeatherMap API key
api_key = os.getenv("OWM_API_KEY")
OWM_Endpoint = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast"
weather_params = {
    "lat": 24.922569,  # Example latitude
    "lon": 72.684761,  # Example longitude
    "appid": api_key,
}

response = requests.get(OWM_Endpoint, params=weather_params)
response.raise_for_status()
weather_data = response.json()

# Determine if rain is expected in the next 12 hours
will_rain = False
hour_data = [item["weather"][0]["id"] for item in weather_data["list"][:4]]
for condition_code in hour_data:
    if int(condition_code) < 700:
        will_rain = True

# Send WhatsApp message based on rain forecast
client = Client(account_sid, auth_token)
if will_rain:
    message = client.messages.create(
        from_='whatsapp:+14155238886',  # Your Twilio WhatsApp sandbox number
        body="Hey Rahul \nIt's going to rain ⛈️ today, Don't forget your Umbrella.☔️",
        to='whatsapp:+916367906870'  # Your phone number
    )
else:
    message = client.messages.create(
        from_='whatsapp:+14155238886',  # Your Twilio WhatsApp sandbox number
        body="Hi Rahul \nIt's going to be a Sunny Day Today. ☀️",
        to='whatsapp:+916367906870'  # Your phone number
    )

print(message.status)
```

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are used to store sensitive information like API keys and authentication tokens, helping to protect your credentials and ensuring they are not hardcoded in your code.

### Why Use Environment Variables?

- **Security**: Protect sensitive data like API keys, passwords, etc.
- **Flexibility**: Easily change values without modifying your code.
- **Portability**: Allows the application to work across different machines and environments.
