### Day 1: Python Basics  
Learned the basics of Python programming, including printing, variables, and string manipulation.  
- **Key Concepts**: `print()`, user input, string concatenation.  

---

### Day 2: Data Types and Arithmetic Operations  
Explored Python data types and mathematical operations.  
- **Key Concepts**: Integers, floats, type conversion, arithmetic operators.  

---

### Day 3: Conditional Statements  
Studied conditional logic and decision-making using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.  
- **Key Concepts**: Comparison and logical operators.  

---

### Day 4: Randomization and Lists  
Introduced randomness and working with Python lists.  
- **Key Concepts**: `random` module, list indexing, and list methods.  

---

### Day 5: Loops and Ranges  
Learned how to work with loops to iterate through data or perform repetitive tasks.  
- **Key Concepts**: `for` loops, `while` loops, `range()`.  

---

### Day 6: Functions and Indentation  
Explored how to define and use functions effectively in Python.  
- **Key Concepts**: Function creation, parameters, and code structure.  

---

### Day 7: Combining Loops and Conditionals  
Practiced integrating loops with conditionals to create interactive programs.  
- **Key Concepts**: Nested loops and conditional checks.  

---

### Day 8: Functions with Parameters  
Enhanced understanding of functions by passing parameters and arguments.  
- **Key Concepts**: Positional arguments, keyword arguments.  

---

### Day 9: Dictionaries and Nested Structures  
Learned how to work with dictionaries and nested data structures.  
- **Key Concepts**: Key-value pairs, dictionary methods, nesting dictionaries and lists.  

---

### Day 10: Functions with Outputs  
Studied how to return values from functions for better modular programming.  
- **Key Concepts**: Return statements, multi-purpose functions.  

---

### Day 11: Combining Concepts  
Applied previously learned concepts (functions, loops, and conditionals) to create advanced programs.  

---

### Day 12: Variable Scope  
Learned about variable scope and its impact on program behavior.  
- **Key Concepts**: Local vs. global scope.  

---

### Day 13: Debugging Techniques  
Practiced debugging Python programs by identifying and fixing errors.  
- **Key Concepts**: Debugging strategies, using `print()` statements, understanding error messages.  

---

### Day 14: Working with External Data  
Explored importing and working with external datasets or data structures.  
- **Key Concepts**: Using attributes, importing modules.  

---

### Day 15: Structuring Code  
Learned to structure code efficiently using functions and dictionaries for scalable applications.  
- **Key Concepts**: Organizing code, modular programming.
